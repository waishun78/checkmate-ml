"This is one of the most profound description of the Chinese race by Chan- Lui Lee PH.D.
You are one of them.
Pls.read and be proud that your forefather left China many years ago to migrate to. Malaysia for abetter future. This is in the DNA of every China man that the next generation will be better than the next 
Happy reading.👏🏻👏🏻👍🏼
This is nice and quite correct and yet truthful summary of Chinese people around the World:

Being Chinese

The simple plain truth about the Chinese!

This Chinese-Australian professor has a funny but true explanation
about the Chinese people. Why do Chinese people work so hard to
succeed in life?

Chinese people don't go about bombing, terrorizing others and causing religious hatred. We live peacefully with everyone on Earth.

Here is the plain truth.

#1. There are over 1 billion of us on this earth. We are like photostat copies of each other. You get rid of one, 5 magically appears (like ballot boxes). Yes, it is scary, especially for us. We acknowledge that we are replaceable, thus we are not particularly 'special'. If you think you are smart, there are a few thousand more people smarter than you. If you think you are strong, there are a few thousand people stronger than you.

#2. We have been crawling all over this earth for far more centuries that most civilizations. Our DNA is designed for survival. We are like cockroaches. Put us anywhere on earth and we will make a colony and thrive. We survive on anything around us and make the best of it. Some keep migrating but others will stay and multiply.

#3. NOBODY cares if we succeed as individuals or not. But our families take pride in knowing we have succeeded. Yes, some will fail. We take nothing for granted. We don't expect privileges to fall on our laps.

No one owes us anything.

#4. We know we have nothing to lose if we try to succeed. Thus, we have no fear trying. That is why Chinese are addicted to gambling. We thrive on taking risks. All or nothing.

#5. From young we are taught to count every cent. What we take for granted like money management, I have found out recently, is not something other cultures practice at home with their children. It surprised me. But truth is not all societies or cultures teach their young this set of skills because it is rude to them. Yes, most of us can count because we are forced to and the logic of money is pounded into us from the beginning of time (when mama tells us how much she has spent on our milk and diapers)

#6. We acknowledge life cycles. We accept that wealth in a family stays for three generations (urban myth?). Thus, every 4th generation will have to work from scratch. I.e. first generation earns the money from scratch, second generation spends the money on education, third generation gets spoiled and wastes all the inheritance. Then we are back to square one. Some families hang on to their wealth a little longer than most.


#7. It is our culture to push our next generation to do better than the last. Be smarter. Be stronger. Be faster. Be more righteous. Be more pious. Be more innovative. Be more creative. Be richer. Be everything that you can be in this lifetime.


#8. Our society judges us by our achievements... and we have no choice but to do something worthwhile because Chinese New Year comes around every year and Chinese relatives have no qualms about asking you straight in your face - how much are you making? When was your last promotion? How big is your office? What car do you drive? Where do you stay? You have boyfriend? You have girlfriend? When are you getting married? When are you having children? When is the next child? When you getting a boy? Got maid yet? Does your company send you overseas? etc etc etc. It NEVER ENDS... so, we can't stop chasing the illusive train - we are damned to a materialistic society. If you are not Chinese, consider yourself lucky!


#9. We have been taught from young that if you have two hands, two feet, two eyes, and a mouth, what are you doing with it? ""People with no hands can do better than you !""


#10. Ironically, the Chinese also believe in giving back to save their wretched materialistic souls. Balance is needed. The more their children succeed in life, the more our parents will give back to society as gratitude for the good fortune bestowed on their children.

Yes. That is true. And that is why our society progresses forward in all conditions.

Nobody pities us.

We accept that.

No one owes us anything.

We know that.

There are too many of us for charity to reach all of us.

We acknowledge that.

But that does not stop us from making a better life.

This lifetime.

Opportunity is as we make of it.

So, pardon us if we feel obliged to make a better place for ourselves in this country we call home.

It is in our DNA to progress forward for a more comfortable life.

But if history were to be our teacher, look around this globe.

Every country has a Chinatown (seriously) but how many government/countries are 'taken' over by the Chinese people.

Don't be afraid of us overwhelming your majority, we are not looking to conquer.

If we have moved away from China and Chinese governed countries, we are NOT looking for another country to administer.

Our representatives are only there to look after our collective welfare. They are duty bound.

We prefer to blend in and enjoy the fruits of our labor.

We enjoy the company of like minded people of all races.

After all, we are only passing through a small period in the history of time... so, use our skills and we can all progress forward together.

"Dear all,
Please be careful.. There is a HIGH TECHNOLOGY SCAM going on at this time called *SIM SWAP FRAUD*, it is said that hundreds of people have been affected, they suddenly found that their bank accounts were *EMPTY*

  How does it work?

 1) The new scam called SIM SWAP starts like this... Your phone network will suddenly go blank / zero (No Signal / Zero Bar) and after a while, you will get a call.

 2)The caller will tell you that he is calling from (your mobile phone company) depending on your network and that there is a problem in your mobile network.

 3)He will instruct you to Please press 1 on your phone to regain network.  - *PLEASE*... at this stage
  don't Press anything, Just hang up or *END* the call.  If you press 4) the network will appear suddenly and in a moment *your HP Will go blank again (Zero Bar) and with that action, your phone *ALREADY HACKED*.

  In a few seconds they will empty your bank account, and you won't receive any notification.. about it.
  It will appear as if your line has been disconnected with no Network, meanwhile your SIM has been *CHANGED*

  The danger here is, you won't get any transaction alerts.

  Let's be more careful",Info/News/Opinion,text,false,1.8333333333333333
"News from Singapore!
Please be sure to wear a mask as the new COVID-Omicron XB variant Corona virus is different, lethal and not easy to detect: -

Symptoms of the new COVID-Omicron XBB virus are as follows: -

    1. No coughing.
    2. No fever.

There are only so many: -

    3. Joint pain.
    4. Headache.
    5. Neck pain.
    6. Upper back pain.
    7. Pneumonia.
    8. Usually no appetite.

Of course, COVID-Omicron XBB is five times more toxic than the Delta variant and has a higher mortality rate than the Delta variant.

It takes less time for the condition to reach extreme severity, and sometimes there are no obvious symptoms.

Let's be more careful!

The strain is not present in the nasopharyngeal region, where it directly affects the lungs, or ""windows,"" in a relatively short period of time.

Several patients diagnosed with Covid Omicron XBB were eventually classified as having no fever, no pain, But X-rays showed mild chest pneumonia.

Nasal swab tests are usually negative for COVID-Omicron XBB, and false negative cases of nasopharyngeal tests are increasing.

This means that the virus can spread in the community and infect the lungs directly, resulting in Viral pneumonia, which in turn causes acute respiratory stress.

This explains why Covid-Omicron XBB has become highly contagious, highly toxic and deadly.

Please note that avoid crowded places and keep a distance of 1.5m even in open areas, Wear a double mask, wear a suitable mask, and wash your hands frequently when you are asymptomatic (no coughing or sneezing).

This Covid Omicron * ""WAVE"" * is more deadly than the first wave of COVID-19. So we have to be very careful and take all kinds of enhanced Coronavirus prevention measures.

Also be vigilant in communicating with your friends and family.

Don't keep this information to yourself, share it with other relatives and friends as much as you can, especially your family and friends.",Info/News/Opinion,text,false,1.75

"🌧️ 🌧️ 🌧️ 🌧️ 🌧️ 🌧️ 🌧️ 

*From today until 30/03/2023, it will be very cold...*

Remember: Starting tomorrow at 05:27, we will experience the APHELION event. Earth is at a different distance from the Sun than normal.

We cannot see this event, but we can feel its impact.  It will last till March.

We may experience colder weather than usual.

It can cause fever, cough and difficulty in breathing. We should strengthen our immune system by consuming foods that strengthen the lungs and heart.

The distance from Earth to Sun is 5 light minutes ie 90,000,000 (9 crore) km.  Aphelion event takes us 152,000,000 (15.2 crore) km from the Sun or 66% of the distance.

Therefore the humidity in the air will increase till the end of March instead of ending in the current month of February due to the south-west monsoon from last July and then the special north-east monsoon for our Tamil Nadu.

Our body... especially those who feel difficulty in breathing,

Older people will see a big difference with this coolness.

So we have to keep our health balanced, whether it's cloudy or sunny, the body still feels cold!!!

And winter can cause feelings of lethargy even in healthy people.

Therefore, appropriate changes should be made from the way you dress to the food you eat.
  
To protect our health... Please share this information with everyone as possible especially family friends who are elderly.  So they might as well be forewarned.",Info/News/Opinion,text,false,1.1666666666666667

"From tomorrow till August 22 the weather will be colder and colder than last year.  This is called the Albelian phenomenon.  It starts tomorrow morning at 5-27.
 We will not only see but also experience the effects of the Alphelion Phenomenon.
 It will end in August 2022.
 During this time we will experience cold weather like never before.. due to which.. our body aches and stuffy throat,
 Fever, cough and breathing problems occur.  Therefore, it is better to strengthen your immune system with vitamins and other healthy food products.
 The distance between Sun and Earth is 90,000,000 km.  But during this Alphelion Phenomenon, the distance between the two will increase to 152,000,000 km.  That is a 66% increase.

 Please share this with family, friends and loved ones.
