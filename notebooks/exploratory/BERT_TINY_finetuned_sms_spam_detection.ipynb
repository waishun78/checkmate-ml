    "The TINY BERT model finetuned using the spam dataset did not perform very well on the dataset available as shown above. Even despite finetuning and changing the threshold for classfication, we were unable to achieve a desirable result. Hence, an alternative model would be preferred. Observing the wrongly classified non-trivial (as trivial) cases, we notice that the statements are conversational/more in the news realm. This means that the model is specifically bad at classifying fake news/fact related messages even though promotional items are easily identified."
