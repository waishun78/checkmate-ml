    "Using mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-sms-spam-detection sequence classification model\n",
    "Tried:\n",
    "1. Without finetuning, just using pretrained model\n",

    "3. With finetuning using 50% checkmate dataset\n",

    "Learnings:\n",
    "The data performed particularly bad on non-promotional messages, particularly those related to information, news or sound more conversational but could be fact chat. This could be attributed the lack of representation within the dataset provided."

    "The TINY BERT model finetuned using the spam dataset did not perform very well on the dataset available as shown above. Even despite finetuning and changing the threshold for classfication, we were unable to achieve a desirable result. Hence, an alternative model would be preferred. Observing the wrongly classified non-trivial (as trivial) cases, we notice that the statements are conversational/more in the news realm. This means that the model is specifically bad at classifying fake news/fact related messages even though promotional items are easily identified."
