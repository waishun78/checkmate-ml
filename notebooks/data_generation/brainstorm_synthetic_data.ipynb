Make sure you read to the end!\\n\\nWritten by Regina Brett, 90 years old, of the Plain Dealer, Cleveland, Ohio.\\n\\n\"To celebrate growing older, I once wrote the 42 lessons life taught me. It is the most requested column I\\'ve ever written.\\nMy odometer rolled over to 90 in August, so here is the column once more:\\n\\n1. Life isn\\'t fair, but it\\'s still good.\\n2. When in doubt, just take the next small step.\\n3. Life is too short – enjoy it..\\n4. Your job won\\'t take care of you when you are sick. Your friends and family will.\\n5. Pay off your credit cards every month.\\n6. You don\\'t have to win every argument. Stay true to yourself.\\n7. Cry with someone. It\\'s more healing than crying alone.\\n8. Save for retirement starting with your first pay check.\\n9. When it comes to chocolate, resistance is futile.\\n10. Make peace with your past so it won\\'t screw up the present.\\n\\n11. It\\'s OK to let your children see you cry.\\n12. Don\\'t compare your life to others. You have no idea what their journey is all about.\\n13. If a relationship has to be a secret, you shouldn\\'t be in it...\\n14 Take a deep breath. It calms the mind.\\n15. Get rid of anything that isn\\'t useful. Clutter weighs you down in many ways.\\n16. Whatever doesn\\'t kill you really does make you stronger.\\n17. It\\'s never too late to be happy. But it’s all up to you and no one else.\\n18. When it comes to going after what you love in life, don\\'t take no for an answer.\\n19. Burn the candles, use the nice sheets, wear the fancy lingerie. Don\\'t save it for a special occasion. Today is special.(amen 💖💖💖)\\n20. Over prepare, then go with the flow.\\n\\n21. Be eccentric now. Don\\'t wait for old age to wear purple.💖\\n22. The most important sex organ is the brain.\\n23. No one is in charge of your happiness but you.\\n24. Frame every so-called disaster with these words \\'In five years, will this matter?\\'\\n25. Always choose life.\\n26. Forgive but don’t forget.\\n27. What other people think of you is none of your business.\\n28. Time heals almost everything. Give time time.\\n29. However good or bad a situation is, it will change.\\n30. Don\\'t take yourself so seriously. No one else does..\\n\\n31. Believe in miracles.\\n32. Don\\'t audit life. Show up and make the most of it now.\\n33. Growing old beats the alternative -- dying young.\\n34. Your children get only one childhood.\\n35. All that truly matters in the end is that you loved.\\n36. Get outside every day. Miracles are waiting everywhere. (I love this one)\\n37. If we all threw our problems in a pile and saw everyone else\\'s, we\\'d grab ours back.\\n38. Envy is a waste of time. Accept what you already have not what you need.\\n39. The best is yet to come...\\n40. No matter how you feel, get up, dress up and show up.\\n41. Yield.\\n42. Life isn\\'t tied with a bow, but it\\'s still a gift.\"\\n\\n(¯`v´¯)\\n`*.¸.*´ ✽¸.•♥♥•.¸✽✽¸.•♥♥•.✽¸✽',\n",

I have to say it is not blind faith but evidential faith. Archaeology and history proves my faith. Delve into it, I pray. Places, (like Hezekial tunnel, Sennacherib's prism which tables the wars of the assyrian King,  people the Bible talks about really exist. Look at Israel. Persecuted but now a nation. God did say He will leave a remnant though the israelittes were a stiff necked people.  The Bible, written by different authors, over thousands of years, speaks congruently on the issue of God, His plans, His heart, Israel, history. It is the only book that has prophecies came true and yet to come true (like the book of revelation). Therefore (the Bible) is reliable. I believe in heaven and hell. I believe God is perfect and He will punish sins on judgement day. But the good news is He gave forgiveness to those who turn to Jesus Christ, repents and follow Him, obey His commandments. I have all reasons to believe in the bible.  I refer you to J Warner Wallace of cold case Christianity. Amen.\",\n",

       " 'This is one of the most profound description of the Chinese race by Chan- Lui Lee PH.D.\\nYou are one of them.\\nPls.read and be proud that your forefather left China many years ago to migrate to. Malaysia for abetter future. This is in the DNA of every China man that the next generation will be better than the next \\nHappy reading.👏🏻👏🏻👍🏼\\nThis is nice and quite correct and yet truthful summary of Chinese people around the World:\\n\\nBeing Chinese\\n\\nThe simple plain truth about the Chinese!\\n\\nThis Chinese-Australian professor has a funny but true explanation\\nabout the Chinese people. Why do Chinese people work so hard to\\nsucceed in life?\\n\\nChinese people don\\'t go about bombing, terrorizing others and causing religious hatred. We live peacefully with everyone on Earth.\\n\\nHere is the plain truth.\\n\\n#1. There are over 1 billion of us on this earth. We are like photostat copies of each other. You get rid of one, 5 magically appears (like ballot boxes). Yes, it is scary, especially for us. We acknowledge that we are replaceable, thus we are not particularly \\'special\\'. If you think you are smart, there are a few thousand more people smarter than you. If you think you are strong, there are a few thousand people stronger than you.\\n\\n#2. We have been crawling all over this earth for far more centuries that most civilizations. Our DNA is designed for survival. We are like cockroaches. Put us anywhere on earth and we will make a colony and thrive. We survive on anything around us and make the best of it. Some keep migrating but others will stay and multiply.\\n\\n#3. NOBODY cares if we succeed as individuals or not. But our families take pride in knowing we have succeeded. Yes, some will fail. We take nothing for granted. We don\\'t expect privileges to fall on our laps.\\n\\nNo one owes us anything.\\n\\n#4. We know we have nothing to lose if we try to succeed. Thus, we have no fear trying. That is why Chinese are addicted to gambling. We thrive on taking risks. All or nothing.\\n\\n#5. From young we are taught to count every cent. What we take for granted like money management, I have found out recently, is not something other cultures practice at home with their children. It surprised me. But truth is not all societies or cultures teach their young this set of skills because it is rude to them. Yes, most of us can count because we are forced to and the logic of money is pounded into us from the beginning of time (when mama tells us how much she has spent on our milk and diapers)\\n\\n#6. We acknowledge life cycles. We accept that wealth in a family stays for three generations (urban myth?). Thus, every 4th generation will have to work from scratch. I.e. first generation earns the money from scratch, second generation spends the money on education, third generation gets spoiled and wastes all the inheritance. Then we are back to square one. Some families hang on to their wealth a little longer than most.\\n\\n\\n#7. It is our culture to push our next generation to do better than the last. Be smarter. Be stronger. Be faster. Be more righteous. Be more pious. Be more innovative. Be more creative. Be richer. Be everything that you can be in this lifetime.\\n\\n\\n#8. Our society judges us by our achievements... and we have no choice but to do something worthwhile because Chinese New Year comes around every year and Chinese relatives have no qualms about asking you straight in your face - how much are you making? When was your last promotion? How big is your office? What car do you drive? Where do you stay? You have boyfriend? You have girlfriend? When are you getting married? When are you having children? When is the next child? When you getting a boy? Got maid yet? Does your company send you overseas? etc etc etc. It NEVER ENDS... so, we can\\'t stop chasing the illusive train - we are damned to a materialistic society. If you are not Chinese, consider yourself lucky!\\n\\n\\n#9. We have been taught from young that if you have two hands, two feet, two eyes, and a mouth, what are you doing with it? \"People with no hands can do better than you !\"\\n\\n\\n#10. Ironically, the Chinese also believe in giving back to save their wretched materialistic souls. Balance is needed. The more their children succeed in life, the more our parents will give back to society as gratitude for the good fortune bestowed on their children.\\n\\nYes. That is true. And that is why our society progresses forward in all conditions.\\n\\nNobody pities us.\\n\\nWe accept that.\\n\\nNo one owes us anything.\\n\\nWe know that.\\n\\nThere are too many of us for charity to reach all of us.\\n\\nWe acknowledge that.\\n\\nBut that does not stop us from making a better life.\\n\\nThis lifetime.\\n\\nOpportunity is as we make of it.\\n\\nSo, pardon us if we feel obliged to make a better place for ourselves in this country we call home.\\n\\nIt is in our DNA to progress forward for a more comfortable life.\\n\\nBut if history were to be our teacher, look around this globe.\\n\\nEvery country has a Chinatown (seriously) but how many government/countries are \\'taken\\' over by the Chinese people.\\n\\nDon\\'t be afraid of us overwhelming your majority, we are not looking to conquer.\\n\\nIf we have moved away from China and Chinese governed countries, we are NOT looking for another country to administer.\\n\\nOur representatives are only there to look after our collective welfare. They are duty bound.\\n\\nWe prefer to blend in and enjoy the fruits of our labor.\\n\\nWe enjoy the company of like minded people of all races.\\n\\nAfter all, we are only passing through a small period in the history of time... so, use our skills and we can all progress forward together.\\n\\n\\nChan-Lui Lee, Ph.D.\\nHonorary Life Membern & Past President, AFS\\nMelbourne,',\n",
       " 'There are two ways to fight a $200 million F-35:\\n\\n🔹You build another stealth fighter, or\\n🔹You puncture the tires of that F-35.\\n\\nThat’s an analogy for using dedollarization to neutralize the American Empire.\\n\\nChina doesn’t want to fight a war with the US and its vassals in Asia. \\n\\nInstead, China will puncture US dollar, which is the foundation of the military industrial complex.\\n\\nFor all those unaware of the tsunami of dedollarization that has just begun all over the world:\\n\\nMAIN ARTICLE \\nBeautiful Things are Happening in Geopolitics!\\nTrue freedom is flourishing from Asia and Africa to Latin America, as the juggernaut of multipolar world rolls forward\\n\\nWhere to begin? There has been an overload of positive news from all over the world! There are outbreaks of peace between intense geopolitical rivals, which would have been unthinkable before… developing countries are suddenly breaking free from the clutches of a rigged global financial system… and a new world order is emerging at an astonishing pace. \\n\\nLet’s take a look at the astounding developments that presage an epochal realignment of geopolitics and geo-economics.\\n\\nWe can break down the historic events into three categories:\\n\\nPeace Movement: In an earth-shattering move, Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to establish diplomatic ties — brokered by China. Saudi Arabia and Iran are also poised to join BRICS and SCO. \\n\\nNext, Syria’s President Assad visited the UAE — an equally astounding rapprochement. He has also been invited to the upcoming Arab Summit. \\n\\nThe third one is about the former Taiwanese President who went on a 12-day trip across mainland China — an unprecedented event since the Chinese civil war ended in 1949. All these are terrible for America’s power, which rests upon chaos, wars, and divide-and-rule.\\n\\nDe-dollarization: Suddenly everyone is finding ways to decouple from the US dollar. Countries are boldly announcing plans to circumvent USD when they trade (especially when buying oil) and engage in e-commerce and tourism. \\n\\nIt’s not just Russia but also US allies and partners like India, Africa, ASEAN, Latin America, Saudi Arabia, and even some European countries are jumping on this bandwagon. The BRICS group is poised to announce its own gold/commodity-backed currency during its summit in August this year. And for the first time, China just bought natural gas (LNG) in Yuan! Hello, petroyuan! Watch out, petrodollar!\\n\\nRevolt against American Hegemony: There is a global revolt against the American Empire. Check out these recent rebellious events:\\n\\n“Mexico is not a colony of the USA” — thundered Mexican President Amlo a couple of days ago on the 85th anniversary of Mexico’s nationalization of oil. This progressive leader nationalized Lithium a month ago, to the great displeasure of his northern Big Brother.\\n\\nSimilarly, El Salvador’s Young and dynamic President Bukele warned the US that Monroe Doctrine is dead. (Bukele has cracked down on violent gangs and drug trafficking, which may have disrupted CIA’s revenue).\\n\\nAnother LatAm country, Honduras, just dumped Taiwan and recognized PRC in mainland China.\\n\\nHeck, even some German leaders are talking about fixing the Nord Stream pipeline and renewing trade with Russia.\\n\\nAnd how about Putin, the supposedly international pariah under 10,000+ US/EU sanctions? Few days ago, 40+ African countries sent representatives to Moscow to attend a conference titled “Africa and Russia in a multipolar world.” Not subtle at all.\\n\\nThen a day later, Xi Jinping visited Moscow for a three-day visit and said that “Changes unseen in a century are happening; and we (Russia and China) are leading this.”\\n\\nAdd to all this is the sudden interest shown by numerous countries in joining BRICS.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Americans are not only in denial about dedollarization but also about its impact on the dollar’s global reserve currency status.\\n\\nHere’s the simple truth: If people don’t need dollar for trade, they don’t need dollar in the foreign exchange reserves either. In the near future, technology and multi-currency trade will turn reserve currencies into an archaic and colonialist notion.\\n\\nDollar itself won’t just disappear but its hegemony will be gone. The US dollar will be one among major currencies such as Euro and Chinese Yuan.\\n\\nUS in Denial\\n\\nAmericans are in for a rude awakening. The mainstream media, pundits and politicians are still engaging in bravado about the supremacy of the US dollar. However, events can unfold like an avalanche.\\n\\nSo, now you have an idea about the bigger picture of the tectonic paradigm shift occurring all over the world. Let’s take a look at these events and see what they mean to the world and even how they affect us.\\n\\nXi-Putin Meeting\\n\\nRussia and China are jump-starting a multipolar world, while the US and Europe are stuck in the delusional past.\\n\\nFirst, Xi’s visit is highly symbolic, showing the world that China got Russia’s back. During the visit, both leaders called each other “Dear friend.” The camaraderie is real. 10 years ago, in March 2013, as the newly elected leader of China, the first trip Xi made was to… Russia to meet Putin. Thus, making another trip on the anniversary is very meaningful.\\n\\nThen, there is the de-dollarization, the mother of all geopolitical phenomenon. Weaken the dollar’s hegemony, you have neutralized America’s unipolar prowess. Putin essentially heralded the death of petrodollar and the birth of petroyuan by making these two points:\\n\\nAlready 2/3rd of Russia-China trade is happening with Yuan and Ruble.\\n\\nFurthermore, Russia will use Chinese Yuan to trade with Asia, Africa and Latin America.\\n\\nHere’s an astonishing chart of how Russia decoupled from dollar and Euro within a couple of months and switched to Yuan and Rubles for trade with China:\\n\\nThen there are other profound changes: Russia using yuan as the main currency in foreign exchange reserves, Russian companies issuing RMB bonds, Russian banks allowing people to open yuan accounts and so on.\\n\\nThe implications of these moves are enormous, as they combine decoupling from US dollar with internationalization of yuan. Double whammy for the US.\\n\\nDe-dollarization\\n\\nOnce Russia and China can establish secure and easy alternatives for non-dollar and non-Western systems, everyone will start using them, at least for some of their trades. Why have a middle-man for trade and commerce that could be accomplished in local currencies?\\n\\nThe use of dollar means (1) forced to hoard $$ in foreign exchange reserves (2) paying commissions (3) being subjected to US diktats in fear of sanctions (4) losing sovereignty and (5) extra friction in doing business.\\n\\nOld world order: If you run out of US dollars, you must go begging to the IMF, which will impose austerity and privatization — i.e., let Western corporations plunder your country.\\n\\nNew world order: You buy oil in your local currency! Or, use another option like the RMB.\\n\\nOld world order: If you are a developing nation, you need to go beg to the IMF and the World Bank.\\n\\nNew world order: If you are a developing nation, China will not only give you the money but will build the infrastructure you need.\\n\\nBy the way, de-dollarization is already spreading like wild fire! Consider these examples:\\n\\nIndia just signed a deal with Malaysia to enable trade in Indian Rupees; and India is working with 18 other countries to do trade in Rupees. These include not only neighbors like Bangladesh and developing countries in Africa, but also staunch US allies/vassals like Germany, UK and New Zealand. India is also in talks with the UAE to buy oil for rupee. Petro-rupee… who would have thought of that?\\n\\nMalaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand now have a digital payment system that enables settlements in local currencies. They have even standardized the QR code payments. No need for the dollar middleman anymore. Now, all ten ASEAN countries — with 600 million people — want to adopt this system and eliminate the use of foreign currencies such as US dollar and Japanese yen in the intra-ASEAN trade.\\n\\nFor the first time, China just bought liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the UAE using Yuan. Kind of a shocking news that should really be on the front page of CN and BBC.\\n\\nAlready, 15% of China’s trade and cross-border payments are happening in yuan — that was about ¥8 trillion in 2022.\\n\\nKenya’s President announced that Saudi Arabia and the UAE will sell oil for Kenyan Shilling! Ghana is buying oil in gold. True freedom for African countries.\\n\\nKenya and Iraq have made it possible for people and businesses to buy things on Alibaba — the Chinese e-commerce giant — with yuan. No need for US dollar in a globalized, hi-tech world.\\n\\nEgypt has joined the BRICS Bank — the New Development Bank. Who needs the predatory IMF and World Bank, who anyway hate giving out loans for infrastructure projects and real development? Egypt is also issuing RMB-denominated bonds.\\n\\nIndonesia’s President Jokowi has told his people to stop using Visa and Mastercard. And the reason he gave? How the US confiscated Russia’s foreign exchange reserves.\\n\\nDuring his visit to China, the Malaysian PM Ibrahim proposed an Asian Monetary Fund to rival the IMF and to reduce dependence on US dollar.\\n\\nBy the way, the new head of BRICS bank is none other than Dilma Rousseff, the former President of Brazil. She was spied on by the NSA, the US spying agency. Later, the US staged a soft coup and removed her from the office by leaking a recorded conversation. Now, she will live in China and manage the New Development Bank. Her influence will likely bring Brazil into BRI - Belt and Road Initiative.\\n\\nBrazil, which is the largest economy in Latin America, is now enabling yuan payments for Brazilian exporters. No more dollar, thank you. As a sign of things to come, the transactions will go through CIPS — the Chinese version of SWIFT. This is a complete decoupling from the post-WW2 financial world order.\\n\\nIn January, Argentina joined 40+ other countries and established a currency-swap agreement with China. It is also trying to set up a new currency for trade within Latin America, especially with Brazil.\\n\\nThe big kahuna in this radical transformation is, of course, Saudi Arabia — the most influential Arab country and the de facto leader of OPEC. Saudi prince MBS is a visionary and shrewd person who understands geopolitics. Consider that public schools in Saudi Arabia are now teaching Chinese language!\\n\\nMBS is making all sorts of long-term deals with China. For his $1 trillion futuristic city - Neom - he is getting yuan-denominated loans from Chinese banks! And Saudi Aramco signed a $12 billion deal to build refineries in China. In the future, Saudis can more quickly export petroleum products to other Asian countries.\\n\\nSaudi Prince Salman has also applied for BRICS membership; and under China’s stewardship, he has made peace with Iran, thus transforming Middle East politics. Peace is also good for China, which wants uninterrupted land mass for its freight trains.\\n\\nWhile modernizing Saudi’s economy, he knows that China will be Saudi’s #1 oil customer for at least two more decades.\\n\\nThe Saudi-Iran deal is also a geopolitical coup de grace for China. It may very well be the cornerstone for petroyuan — i.e., oil being sold for Chinese RMB. Obviously, this detente paves the way for both Saudi Arabia and Iran to join BRICS. (Even Forbes magazine predicts that Saudi Arabia will become an official member of BRICS at the Aug 2023 Summit).\\n\\nMore than 12 countries have sent in their applications for BRICS membership, as South Africa’s foreign minister admitted — South Africa holds the current BRICS presidency.\\n\\nBRICS expansion map. “BRICS+”?\\nImagine a BRICS+ with three oil giants — Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran. And perhaps even UAE, Mexico, Venezuela and Nigeria. The “BRICS+” can account for 60% of world’s oil production! How hard will it be to create a new currency that’s backed by oil? Or even a combo of commodities — oil, natural gas, wheat, iron ore etc.? Remember that Russia and Iran are #1 and #2 in natural gas reserves of the world.\\n\\nEndless possibilities in a multipolar world!\\n\\n(As I have explained in the previous article, Chinese Yuan can/will become a global trade currency without it becoming a major global reserve currency. Note: Already 70+ countries are using Chinese RMB in their foreign exchange reserves portfolio. Brazil recently announced that Yuan has surpassed the Euro in Brazilian FOREX! This is especially astounding given that, as recently as 2018, Brazil had no yuan in its FOREX!)\\n\\nHow long before the local de-dollarization stories are replicated worldwide? This is just a matter of scaling that needs the right governance and technology.\\n\\nImagine a future when any person in any country can directly and instantly trade with anyone in the world!\\n\\nAll the US sanctions and bullying will become meaningless. Already, look how most of the world is ignoring US/EU sanctions on Russia.\\n\\nThe proof is in the pudding. Look at how Russia’s exports of crude oil, petroleum products, LNG and coal have been virtually unaffected by US/EU sanctions. The message from Global South to the imperialists about the Ukraine war is clear: “Your monkey, Your circus.”\\n\\nBRICS and BRI — Challenging US Hegemony\\n\\nBRICS started off as a virtual concept created by Goldman Sachs. Then, after the 2008 financial crisis, BRICS became more serious, although the US constantly sabotaged it from becoming meaningful. The weakest links are Brazil and India. Brazil has a lot of pro-US elites; and India is probably hesitant to allow BRICS to grow too strong because it will mean a stronger China.\\n\\nRight now, BRICS is larger than the US in terms of nominal GDP and larger than the G7 nations in terms of PPP GDP.\\n\\nThus, BRICS has a lot of potential. With a few more members, BRICS won’t be held hostage by Indian and Brazilian politics.\\n\\nThe new President of “BRICS Bank” - formally, the New Development Bank - is Dilma Rousseff, who is the former President of Brazil. She has moved to Shanghai! Imagine that — former world leaders moving to and living in China.\\n\\nSimilarly, China’s Belt and Road Initiative has great potential to transform the world. With 147 members, the BRI is a transformative paradigm. Hopefully, some European countries will also grow spines, reject the life as American vassals, and embrace the BRI and a cooperative world. All the propaganda about debt traps or failures of projects is cynical and either exaggerated or blatantly false. If these holier-than-thou people are so concerned about debt trap, they should join the BRI, propose noble reforms and offer cheap loans.\\n\\nPeace and Development\\n\\nPoor countries have enormous challenges with the basics and are caught in a Catch-22. To get out of poverty, they need to build infrastructure; but to build infrastructure, they need money! These countries suffer when there are endless perpetual wars that disrupt global supply chains and trade. Plus, Western institutions don’t give loans for infrastructure. US military bases? Yes. Hydropower dams and internet connections? No!\\n\\nThe Middle East, for example, has so much wealth but many Arab countries are poor and/or destroyed by wars. This is why peace between Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria and the UAE is a game changer. The leaders are finally realizing how much more they can accomplish through cooperation. It’s as if there is a spiritual awakening!\\n\\nHistoric Saudi-Iran peace deal brokered by China (in Beijing). Syrian president Assad and his wife in UAE for peace summit\\nThe only ones to benefit from conflicts are the US and the EU. Divide Sunnis and Shiites, Arabs and Persians… the US gets to be the hegemon of a pivotal region. Plus, keeping Iran down helps US/EU oil/gas companies make enormous profits. Of course, selling weapons is also a big industry in the US.\\n\\nNeedless to say, what’s happening in the Middle East is amazing. After decades of brutal civil wars, proxy wars and religious wars, Arab leaders are having an epiphany: “Hey, how about we cooperate with one another and find win-win ideas for peace and prosperity?”\\n\\nThis process is not easy. It requires enormous diplomacy and willingness to forgive. However, the dividends of peace and development will be astronomical. And they can lay the framework for other countries to resolve their issues as well.\\n\\nImagine peace between:\\n\\nNorth and South Korea\\n\\nIndia versus China/Pakistan\\n\\nChina and Japan\\n\\nRussia and Europe\\n\\nOne final note: The Saudi-Iran peace deal is also a proof of another phenomenon: China’s growing geopolitical clout and mastery. It’s not just a “workshop of the world” anymore. Who knows, maybe the Chinese will play a great role in ending the Ukraine war as well.\\n\\nArrogance and Ignorance\\n\\nThe globalist magazine Economist had a clever cover page that shows the axis of China-Russia-Iran-Saudi.\\n\\n25 years ago, geopolitical mastermind Brzezinski wrote in his book — Grand Chessboard — that the biggest threat to American hegemony will be the coalition of China, Iran and Russia. Well, thanks to terribly flawed US foreign policy, that grand alliance is coming to fruition. Add Saudi Arabia to this group, and you get far-reaching geopolitical multiplier effects.\\n\\nThe Economist article is replete with anti-China propaganda and classic misconceptions. Such ignorance is why the West missed the reemergence of China as a global power. But Western intellectuals are just doubling down on their failed analyses. \\n\\nApart from the usual trope about “authoritarian CCP,” the author’s faux pas is to dismiss China’s foreign policy as “transactional.” \\n\\nIt’s quite the opposite. China makes 20- and 30-year deals with Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. And the deals are also holistic — covering everything from trade and technology to infrastructure and agriculture to cultural exchange and beyond. For example, Saudi Aramco just agreed to invest $10 billion on a massive refinery in China. Saudis will also store millions of barrels in China to export quickly to other Asian countries.\\n\\nAlso, the cover art shows China as a hegemonic power and others as satellites. However, this is a Western projection. In reality, China and Russia are partners, who are breaking the American stranglehold on the world. Also, many are starting to have a different opinion about who is the true “axis of evil” — US, UK, NATO and the little Nazis of Ukraine.\\n\\nWhile American politicians like to constantly demonize “communist” China, guess who’s going to Beijing? Singapore Prime Minister this week (for 6 days!); Malaysian PM and Spanish Prime Minister also this week; French President Macron and EU President Ursula von der Leyen in early April; Brazil’s Lula the following week and so on.\\n\\nThe hubris and ignorance in Washington/London/Brussels bubble are astounding. On one hand, US sanctions (weaponization of USD) and warmongering are accelerating the death of dollar hegemony, which underpins American power and prosperity. On the other hand, Europeans are meekly accepting their vassal state and sacrificing their economy, security — and potentially their lives — as geopolitical pawns in the proxy war against Russia.\\n\\nMoreover, the US/EU financial systems have become Ponzi schemes on top of unsustainable debt and mind-boggling amount of derivatives. The de-industrialized Western economies can’t even supply Ukraine with enough ammunition. The American economy is a “fugazi” — financial capitalism with fake wealth created by printing trillions of dollars and hiding failures with bailouts, a.k.a. socialism for oligarchs and banksters.\\n\\nAll these are possible only because of the rigged global system.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe American Empire is based on three things: Dollar, Military, and Divide-and-Rule.\\n\\nAnd all three pillars of the Matrix are crumbling in real time.\\n\\nEverything is changing in the blink of an eye. The East is uniting and rising; and the West is on a self-destruction path. A multipolar world is blossoming and the centers of gravity for economy and diplomacy are shifting to Asia. The de-dollarization movement is gaining momentum faster than anyone could have imagined.\\n\\nPeace is emasculating mighty America. If Saudis and Iranians are friends, if Taiwan and China forge a compromise, if India and China settle their borders… America’s ability to manufacture wars and control others will evaporate.\\n\\nAs for military dominance, Russia and China already have hypersonic missiles, while the US program has failed and is now at least a decade behind. As for US Navy, it is not only unable to build enough warships but is also dependent on China for precision tools, electronics, rare earth minerals and even aluminum. In essence, the USA is turning into a paper tiger.\\n\\nThe best-case scenario is that Western leaders understand that their domination is over and will work with China, Russia and others to implement a new world order based on cooperation, equality and mutual prosperity. However, I am not holding my breath for that to happen.',\n",
